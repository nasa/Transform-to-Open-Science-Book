On 11 January 2023 the US White House — joined by 10 federal agencies, a coalition of more than 85 universities, and other organizations — declared 2023 to be a Year of Open Science!

This year will celebrate the benefits and successes of open science and inspire more scientists to adopt open science. Ultimately, the success of a Year of Open Science will be driven by collaborations with individuals, teams, and organizations who are ready to transform the culture of science into one that celebrates openness, and inclusion! 

The Year of Open Science has set out 4 goals to work towards:
1. Develop a strategic plan for open science
1. Improve the transparency, integrity, and equity of reviews
1. Account for open science activities in evaluations
1. Engage underrepresented communities in the advancement of open science

## For You and For Your Team
The Year of Open Science is not just for organizations, check out our Year of Open Science materials for you and your team!

### Individual Participation
Are you just beginning your open science journey? Perhaps you have only just begun to post your code or data online, share your pre-prints, or share your null hypothesis as part of your grant application? Or perhaps you are exploring science communication on a personal blog. All of these behaviors exemplify open science and we would like for you to join us! 

If you are excited to learn and encourage others to learn about open science as part of a Year of Open Science, then we invite you to explore how to take [Individual Actions for a Year of Open Science](https://nasa.github.io/Transform-to-Open-Science-Book/Open_Science_Cookbook/Your_Open_Science_Journey.html#section-3-open-science-at-work)!

### Team Participation
Is your team interested in adopting open science principles and practices, but unsure of how to begin? The Year of Open Science team activities could help you reflect together on how to equip the people at your organization with practical knowledge in open science, as well as introduce them to a wider community of open science practitioners. 

Learn how to get your team involved in [Team Actions for Year of Open Science](https://nasa.github.io/Transform-to-Open-Science-Book/Open_Science_Cookbook/Your_Teams_Open_Science_Journey.html#section-1-engage-with-open-science)!
