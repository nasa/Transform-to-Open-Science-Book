# About NASA Transform to Open Science

## What We Do

The world is changing rapidly. Everyday new problems emerge and it takes groundbreaking scientific discoveries to solve them. To stay ahead, the pace of science must accelerate and science needs to be even better, more accurate, and faster to enable the truly transformative breakthroughs that will help us thrive. Closed science, hoarding information and resources, silos of knowledge holds science back by limiting who can participate. We need more voices that work together and share knowledge and resources. Only then will we find new and better solutions. NASA's Transform to Open Science (TOPS) mission will allow us to create a scientific culture that is ready for 21st century challenges. Open Science will **broaden participation, increase accessibility to knowledge, and embrace new technologies** that can respond to these changes at scale. We hope you will join us in creating an open science infrastructure in your organization.

## Strategic Objectives

Open Science creates more advanced and inclusive research faster, builds a more just and equitable world, and ensures that minds from all walks of life can participate in science. TOPS is NASA’s ambitious plan to accelerate open science practices. It’s a 5-year journey that will  
1. Accelerate major scientific discoveries 
2. Broaden participation by historically excluded communities 
3. Increase understanding and adoption of open science principles and techniques
