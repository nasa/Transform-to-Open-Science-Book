On 11 January 2023 the US White House — joined by 10 federal agencies, a coalition of more than 85 universities, and other organizations — declared 2023 to be a Year of Open Science!

This year will celebrate the benefits and successes of open science and inspire more scientists to adopt open science. Ultimately, the success of a Year of Open Science will be driven by collaborations with individuals, teams, and organizations who are ready to transform the culture of science into one that celebrates openness, and inclusion! 

The Year of Open Science has set out 4 goals to work towards:
1. Develop a strategic plan for open science
1. Improve the transparency, integrity, and equity of reviews
1. Account for open science activities in evaluations
1. Engage underrepresented communities in the advancement of open science

## Thank You for Joining Us in a Year of Open Science!
We would like to give a special thank you to organizations that participated with us in a Year of Open Science.
